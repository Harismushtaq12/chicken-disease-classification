# chicken-disease-classification
An image-based chicken disease classification project using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
# 🐔 Chicken Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying chicken diseases from images using deep learning techniques.  
It aims to assist in early disease detection for better poultry health management.

## 📌 Project Overview

Chicken diseases can cause serious losses in poultry farming. Traditional diagnosis methods are time-consuming and require expert knowledge.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically classify chicken diseases from image data.

The model is trained and evaluated using a publicly available Kaggle dataset.

## 📁 Dataset Used

**Chicken Disease 1 – Kaggle Dataset**

🔗 Dataset link:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allandclive/chicken-disease-1

The dataset contains labeled images of different chicken diseases and healthy chickens, divided into training and testing sets.

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size limitations.  
> Please download it manually from Kaggle and place it inside the `data/` directory.
