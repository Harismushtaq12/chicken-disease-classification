# chicken-disease-classification
An image-based chicken disease classification project using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
# 🐔 Chicken Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying chicken diseases from images using deep learning techniques.  
It helps poultry farmers and veterinarians detect diseases early and reduce losses.
